# Issues

Having all 17 tests passed. creating the code on the app.js took the most time.

creating the prompt was a quick and easy step but making the .then go into cases which would go 

to certain function depending on the user choice to work as a whole was a challenge and alot of googling involved.

Running the validations was an easy choice but getting the correct code took some searching onm stack overflow and github

to find the best way to work with the code.
